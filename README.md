The Adventures of Marma-Badge

This project/game was created so I could use it to propose to my girlfriend. 
The idea was to:
* Create various levels that relate to both of us in some way
* Needing to finish each level to collect "relics" that give access to a main tower
* I am in the main tower held by my arch nemisis and my girlfriend must defeat it
* Once defeated, and I am free, I (in the game and realtime) will propose

My initial goal was to build a Unity application targeting Xbox One console.
Most of my development was targeting a windows build (since it was easier to test and also hide from my g/f).
I had a deadline of when I wanted to propose and the week leading up to it, I had so many issues when
deploying to the Xbox One that instead, I reverted to just running it on my laptop, hdmi'd into a tv and using 
the Xbox controller for my g/f, pretty close to the Xbox One experience. 

What were the Xbox One issues? Too many, basically refused to run certain levels and had random crashes. 

Anyhow, I also had my g/f play while streaming on Twitch to our friends/family, so they could see in real-time the
game and her progress.
