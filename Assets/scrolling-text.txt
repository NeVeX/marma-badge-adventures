Episode 69


SexyLand


A once peaceful world, 
is now in great peril!


:-(



An evil overlord called 
"Steve the Steve" has captured and 
imprisioned our supreme leader 
Mystic Marktholomew.



A (non-white) princess/warrior 
must save this world from the 
throes of it's evil loneliness 
and general unease.



The Gods of this world are too 
weak to defeat stubborn Steve, 
since he has hidden their 
(oddly accessible) power relics 
in the far reaches of this 
...SexyLand.




Please, if you are a non-white 
princess/warrior, come help us! 





You're our only hope! 






(Unless lots of ye show up, 
in which case, please do not 
double park or block entrances, 
the world council is already 
upset with us from last week's 
huge turnout to Sexy Bingo)













Anyhoo...to summarize
as a TLDR with help from 
Sting and The Police...









S.O.S girl! 









Awwww yeah!!








Come on!!








But seriously we need help,
like for realz
