# marma-badge-adventures
The Wonderful Adventures of Marma-Badge!

So...this project/game was created so that I could use it to propose to my girlfriend. 

The idea was to:
* Create some type of an "adventure" game, with various levels that must be completed 
* Each of the various levels would relate to both of us in some way (things we like, have done, have joked about...our fears!)
* She would need to finish each level to collect "relics" that give access to a main tower
* I am in the main tower held by my arch nemisis and my girlfriend must defeat it
* Once defeated, which frees me, I (in the game and realtime) will propose to her to continue on her/Marma-Badge adventures!

Why the name Marma-Badge? That's a (dumb) story for another time. The last level pays homage to this (stupid) name too.

My initial goal was to build a Unity application targeting the Xbox One console.
Most of my development was targeting a windows build (since it was easier to test and also hide from my g/f).
I had a deadline of when I wanted to propose (that kept slipping) so the week leading up to it, I had so many issues when
deploying to the Xbox One that instead, I reverted to just running it on my laptop, HDMI'd into a tv and using 
the Xbox controller for my g/f, pretty close to the Xbox One experience. 

What were the Xbox One issues? Too many, basically refused to run certain levels and had random crashes. 

Anyhow, I had my g/f play for the first time while also streaming on Twitch to our friends/family, so they could see in real-time the
game and her progress.

Also, she said yes! :-)

# Dev notes
* I think I checked in everything
* I'm using LTS for the large files, so make sure to have lts support in git (should be included in latest versions
* This took way too long to complete
* It's full of bugs most likely - happy path was the most important thing though!
